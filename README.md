# Raspberry Pi Pico and LoRaWAN from CircuitPython

Enable LoRaWAN communications on your [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) or any RP2040-based board using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) and the Adafruit [TinyLoRa](https://github.com/adafruit/TinyLoRa) library.

## Setting up The Things Network


## Adding Keys


## Deploying to Pico

Copy the contents of the [`src/`](https://github.com/aallan/pico-lorawan-circuitpython/tree/main/src) directory to your `CIRCUITPY` drive.

* the code.py file
* the `lib/` folder and all of its contents (including subfolders and `.mpy` files)


## Decoder

We're sending out temperature reading as a byte array

```C
temp = microcontroller.cpu.temperature
temp = int(temp * 100)

data = bytearray(2)
data[0] = (temp >> 8) & 0xFF
data[1] = temp & 0xFF
```

By default the payload is displayed as a hexidecimal values in the Network Console. However we can add a 

```javascript
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  var decoded = {};

  // Decode bytes to int
  var celciusInt = (bytes[0] << 8) | bytes[1];
  
  // Decode int to float
  decoded.temp = celciusInt / 100;

  return decoded;
```
